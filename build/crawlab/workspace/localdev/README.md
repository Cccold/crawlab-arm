# Local Dev

For those who want to develop or contribute to crawlab project can use `docker-compose.yml` to start necessary containers (fs, mongo) to support local development.

Please make sure you have installed [Docker](https://docker.io) and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

## Start Containers

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Stop Containers

```bash
docker-compose down
```
